## Reporting a Vulnerability

The DefianceNetwork team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@defiancenetwork.dev**

Include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
3. **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Any special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
5. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
7. **Impact of the vulnerability**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

We will make every effort to respond to security reports within **48 hours** and will keep you informed throughout the process.

Our typical response process:

1. **Initial Response** (within 48 hours): Acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Investigation** (within 7 days): Validate and reproduce the vulnerability
3. **Resolution** (within 30 days): Develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure** (coordinated): Public disclosure after fix is deployed

### Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. However, we will:

- Acknowledge your contribution in our security advisories
- Credit you in our CHANGELOG (if desired)
- Provide recognition in our community channels

## Security Considerations

### Cryptocurrency Operations

DefianceNetwork handles cryptocurrency transactions and private keys. Special attention is given to:

- **Private Key Management**: Keys are generated using cryptographically secure random sources
- **Transaction Security**: All transactions are validated and signed locally
- **Network Security**: P2P communications are encrypted end-to-end
- **Bridge Security**: Cross-chain transfers include confirmation monitoring and refund mechanisms

### P2P Network Security

Our decentralized architecture includes several security measures:

- **Peer Authentication**: All peers are authenticated using digital signatures
- **Content Validation**: Distributed content is cryptographically verified
- **Anti-Spam Measures**: Rate limiting and reputation systems prevent abuse
- **Privacy Protection**: User activity is kept private by default

### Data Protection

- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- **No Central Servers**: User data never leaves their device unless explicitly shared
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: No personally identifiable information is collected
- **Secure Communications**: All network traffic is encrypted

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Wallet Security
- **Backup Private Keys**: Store backup copies of wallet files securely
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Protect wallet files with strong, unique passwords
- **Verify Transactions**: Always verify transaction details before confirming
- **Keep Software Updated**: Install security updates promptly

### Network Security
- **Firewall Configuration**: Consider firewall rules for P2P ports
- **VPN Usage**: Use VPN for additional privacy if desired
- **Trusted Networks**: Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks

### General Security
- **Official Releases**: Only download from official GitHub releases
- **Verify Signatures**: Check GPG signatures on release artifacts (when available)
- **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious activity or security concerns

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow a **responsible disclosure** approach:

1. **Coordination**: We work with security researchers to understand and fix vulnerabilities
2. **Timeline**: We aim to fix critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
3. **Public Disclosure**: We disclose vulnerabilities only after fixes are available
4. **Credit**: We acknowledge researchers who help improve our security

## Security Audits

### Internal Security Measures

- **Automated Security Scanning**: cargo-audit and cargo-deny in CI/CD
- **Code Review**: All code changes require security-focused review
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing of P2P and crypto components

### External Audits

We welcome external security audits and will coordinate with security firms for:

- **Cryptocurrency Components**: Bridge and wallet functionality
- **P2P Network**: Peer discovery and communication protocols
- **Cryptographic Implementation**: Key generation and encryption systems

## Security Frameworks and Standards

DefianceNetwork follows established security frameworks:

- **OWASP Guidelines**: Web application security best practices
- **Cryptocurrency Security Standards**: Industry best practices for blockchain applications
- **P2P Security Models**: Established patterns for decentralized networks
- **Rust Security Guidelines**: Memory safety and secure coding practices
